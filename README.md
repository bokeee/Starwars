# A sample modular Android app
This sample app has been developed with Kotlin following an MVVM architecture pattern with a modular approach.

# Working
![Working](app_flow.gif)

# Branches
## [master](https://github.com/karntrehan/Starwars/tree/coroutines)
* **[Koin](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin)**: Dependency injection
* **[Reactive streams](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)**: Networking & Async.
* **[LiveData and ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture)**: Isolate business logic and maintain state.

## [coroutines](https://github.com/karntrehan/Starwars/tree/coroutines)
* **[Dagger 2](https://dagger.dev/)**:Dependency injection
* **[Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html)**: Networking & Async.
* **[LiveData and ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture)**: Isolate business logic and maintain state.

# Decisions
* **Koin**: This is my first experiment with Koin, and it turned out to be straight-forward to implement. The performance is also great. Although, feature module support is something they are still working on.
* **Modular**: The app is developed with a modular approach to support instant apps & dynamic delivery for the users. Modularity also allows us to have faster gradle build speeds, clear ownerships amongst the team & cleaner git flows. More info about modular apps can be found [here](https://medium.com/mindorks/writing-a-modular-project-on-android-304f3b09cb37).

# Structure
`app` module is where the application initializes & `characters` dynamic module is where our sample screens reside. 
`CharacterActivity` holds the `CharacterSearchFragment` & `CharacterDetailsFragment`.
The packages are "by-feature" for easier access.

# Running
You will need a device / emulator with Android Oreo (API 27) and up.

# Testing
Test cases for the [`CharacterSearchVM`](characters/src/test/java/com/karntrehan/starwars/characters/search/CharacterSearchVMTest.kt) & [`CharacterDetailsVM`](characters/src/test/java/com/karntrehan/starwars/characters/details/CharacterDetailsVMTest.kt) have been implemented.

# Todo
* ~~Coroutines on Details screen in `coroutines` branch~~
